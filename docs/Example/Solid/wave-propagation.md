# [★★★☆☆] Propagation of A Planar Wave

In this example, we demonstrate an example of wave propagation in a 2D solid.

Essentially, it is a 2D dynamics problem. The [CP4](../../Library/Element/Membrane/Plane/CP4.md) element is used to
model the solid. Various time integration methods will be used to compare their performance regarding numerical energy
dispersion.

The model script can be downloaded [here](wave-propagation.supan).

**Due to small step size and need to export visualization data, the full analysis takes around 20 minutes to complete on
an average PC platform.**

## Model

A square solid of size $$3200\times3200$$ is used. The structured mesh can be generated by using whatever mesh generator
available. It is not difficult to generate an array of squares using scripting languages such as Python or Matlab.
Here, [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) is used.

The left and right boundary are constrained along the horizontal direction. The bottom boundary is constrained along the
vertical direction. A concentrated vertical load is applied at the centre of the top boundary.

### Material

Whether plane stress or plane strain assumption is adopted is not the focus of this example, thus, we simply use a plane
stress element with a unit thickness.

### BC

The boundaries can be extracted by [generating](../../Collection/Define/generate.md) node groups.

### Time Integration

We use both implicit and explicit time integration methods.
