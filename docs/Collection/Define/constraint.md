# constraint

Please refer to specific constraint types provided for details.

All constraints are processed in **parallel**.

Most constraints are implemented in both the penalty function and Lagrange multiplier methods. A brief discussion on 
the difference can be found in the [Constraint](../../Library/Constraint/Constraint.md) page.
