# OS146S

Open Section Wrapper

Wraps a 1D host material model into a 2D plane model that can be used with open sections.

## Syntax

```
material OS146S (1) (2) (3)
# (1) int, unique tag
# (2) int, 3D material tag
# (3) double, shear modulus
```

The response of attached 1D material model will be output when recorded.

The name `OS146S` suggests that the first (1) $$\sigma_{11}$$, the fourth (4) $$\tau_{12}$$ and
the sixth (6) $$\tau_{13}$$ components are active.
All other components are assumed to be zero.

The shear response is always linear elastic with the shear modulus specified in the third argument.

The normal strain is sent to the 1D material model as the axial strain.
