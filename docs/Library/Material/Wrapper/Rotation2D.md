# Rotation2D

2D Rotation Wrapper

Alters the inclination of the 2D host material model, it is typically used with anisotropic material models.

## Syntax

```
material Rotation2D (1) (2) (3)
# (1) int, unique material tag
# (2) int, associated material tag
# (3) double, angle rotated (anti-clockwise positive)
```

The response of attached 2D material model will be output when recorded.
