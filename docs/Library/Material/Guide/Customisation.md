# Customisation

A number of universal wrappers are provided for uniaxial material models. Analysts can flexibly combine arbitrary number
of simple material models to behave under a certain rheology structure.

The [`Parallel`](../Wrapper/Parallel.md) and [`Sequential`](../Wrapper/Sequential.md) wrappers can be used to create
models that are rate independent.
