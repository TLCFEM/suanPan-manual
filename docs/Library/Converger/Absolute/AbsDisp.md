# AbsDisp

Absolute Displacement

This converger tests the following norm,

$$
\left|\mathbf{U}\right|_\infty\leqslant{}tol.
$$

where $$\mathbf{U}$$ denotes the total displacement of the system (with all trial displacement increments accounted).
This means

$$
\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{U}_n+\sum_{i=1}^{k}\Delta\mathbf{U}^i,
$$

where $$\mathbf{U}_n$$ denotes the converged displacement at the beginning of current sub-step and
$$\Delta\mathbf{U}^i$$ denote all displacement increments/corrections generated by all iterations of the sub-step.
