Absolute Acceleration Increment

In the governing equation,

$$
\mathbf{M\Delta{}A=R},
$$

this converger tests the norm of displacement increment, viz.,

$$
\left|\mathbf{\Delta{}A}\right|\leqslant{}tol.
$$

The equation of motion based on acceleration is conventionally the governing equation in explicit analysis.
