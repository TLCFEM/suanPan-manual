# WAT2

The generalized explicit Runge-Kutta-Nystr√∂m framework with the second scheme presented in [10.1002/nme.7658](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.7658).
It is called WAT2 because it is the second scheme by the authors Wang, Adams and Tamma.

## Syntax

```text
integrator WAT2 (1) [2]
# (1) int, unique integrator tag
# [2] double, parameter, default: 1/3
```

## Remarks

The parameter $$r$$ is a ratio between zero and unity.
It yields $$C_1$$ ranging from $$0.3$$ to $$0.4$$ as recommended in the reference.

$$
C_1=0.3+0.1r.
$$

The default value of $$r=1/3$$ yields $$C_1=1/3$$.
