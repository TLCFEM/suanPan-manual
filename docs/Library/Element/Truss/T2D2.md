# T2D2

2D Linear Truss

* Number of Nodes: 2
* Number of DoFs: 2 (Translation, Translation)

## Syntax

```
element T2D2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) [6] [7] [8]
# (1) int, unique element tag
# (2) int, node i
# (3) int, node j
# (4) int, material tag
# (5) double, cross sectional area
# [6] bool string, nonlinear geometry switch, default: false
# [7] bool string, if to update sectional area, default: false
# [8] bool string, if to use log strain, default: false
```

## Remarks

1. The corotational formulation is implemented, turn on the nonlinear geometry switch to use it.
2. According to different implementations of details, either a constant area or a constant volume assumption is adopted.
   If the volume is constant, the cross-sectional area would be updated based on $$A=\dfrac{A_0L_0}{L}$$.
3. The computation of strain can be altered from engineering strain (by default) to log strain.
4. By turning on all three switches, full nonlinearity can be achieved.
