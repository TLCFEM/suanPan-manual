# S4

Four Node Shell Element

The `S4` shell element uses [`Mindlin`](../Plate/Mindlin.md) plate element combined
with [`GQ12`](../Membrane/Drilling/GQ12.md) element.

* Number of Nodes: 4
* Number of DoFs: 6 (Translation, Translation, Translation, Rotation, Rotation, Rotation)

## Syntax

```
element S4 (1) (2...5) (6) (7) [8]
# (1) int, unique element tag
# (2...5) int, node i, j, k, l
# (6) int, material tag
# (7) double, thickness
# [8] bool, nonlinear geometry switch, default: false
```

## Remarks

1. If the nonlinear geometry switched on, the transformation between the global and local reference frames will depend
   on the current displacement. The nonlinear transformation is similar to the corotational transformation, and the
   local response is still linear. Thus, it follows "large displacement, small deformation" assumption.
