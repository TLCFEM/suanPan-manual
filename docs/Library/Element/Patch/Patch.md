Isogeometric Patches

In isogeometric analysis, the geometry of elements is defined by NURBS based surfaces or volumes. Several elements are
grouped into patches and patches behave similar to traditional finite elements.

To define IGA patches, the knot vectors along each dimension and the control node polygon need to be assigned.
