# Introduction

This repository provides user manual for [suanPan](https://tlcfem.github.io/suanPan/). If you are browsing the GitHub
repository, please visit the following sites for a better
presentation.

1. [https://tlcfem.gitbook.io/suanpan-manual/](https://tlcfem.gitbook.io/suanpan-manual/) This site uses GitBook. The
   support for math expressions is good. Inline math expressions are rendered properly.
2. [http://suanpan-manual.rtfd.io/](http://suanpan-manual.rtfd.io/) This site uses [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
   The theme supports both light and dark mode. But there are additional brackets surrounding inline math expressions.
   The documentation generated by [`doxygen`](https://www.doxygen.nl/) is also included under `Doxygen` section. Things
   like calling graph, class hierarchy and function documentation are presented. Check it out if you are interested in
   the source code.

I'm still working on this site from time to time. Hence, it is unlikely to get a complete reference by solely checking
this site. For any potential doubts, please feel free to contact me.

## Where to Start?

I know it is not easy to pick up a new finite element analysis tool, but it is not impossible. The logic of input file
resembles that of ABAQUS. If you have some experience with ABAQUS, it shall be easy to create a simple model by hand.

After a simple demo presented in [Analyze](Basic/Analyze.md), you are recommended to check
out [Syntax](Basic/Syntax.md) and [Structure](Basic/Structure.md) to gain an overall picture of how an input file
would look like.

The `Example` section includes a number of examples with various degrees of complexity, check the ones you are familiar
with, or simple ones such as [Linear Analysis of A Truss Roof](Example/Structural/Statics/truss-roof.md)
and [Dynamic Analysis of A Portal Frame](Example/Structural/Dynamics/dynamic-analysis-of-a-portal-frame.md), as the
starting point.

The `Collection` section includes the top level commands used to develop finite element models.

The `Library` section contains all specific elements, materials, etc., that are available.

## Summary

Here is a complete [table of contents](SUMMARY.md). If you are interested in the architecture of the program, you can
check the [slides](ARCH.pdf) I prepared for a talk.

## About

Many FEM packages are available out there so why another package? Commercial packages are great, but may be too
expensive for individuals to get access to. The limited extensibility is another pain in the butt. Modern programming
paradigms for parallel computing have evolved a lot in recent years. C++ itself has also received a huge amount of
updates starting from `C++11`. `suanPan` is basically a practice of modern parallel computing with brand-new language
features. The civil/structural community also needs an update of new tools for efficient numerical analysis. `suanPan`
is designed to offer a concise but highly extensible framework for finite element analysis. With the assist
of `Armadillo`, the syntax of which is expressive, researchers can try out new ideas in a fairly easy manner.

## Contribution

To contribute, please create pull requests. Besides, if you find any typos, please also feel free to create issues.

All third party libraries must provide a single markdown file to explain how to use the library and if possible with
some theories.

It may be convenient to build the manual locally, please check [Build](Basic/Build.md) for more details.
